# volley-scoreboar

Volley Scoreboard is a Windows application which allows to trasform your computer and display in a simple Volley Scoreboard.

It can be used for amateur volleyball associations and amateur tournaments.

Use it with a single display (using shortcuts to change the score) or better with an external tv display or projector changing the score with the control panel. 


## How to build

To build the application use Visual Studio Community 2017 (free for students, open-source and individual developers).
You only need to open the solution and build the release version.

The project is configured to build a fully statically linked .exe so it doesn't need to be installed and it can be used as portable application.
